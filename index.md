## About Me

Hi! I am Rajeshwari, and welcome to my little niche on the web.  
I got my Masters in English at Jawaharlal Nehru University, in June, 2025.  
I have a versatile portmanteau of knowledge and experience in content writing, editing, research, documentation, communication and leadership. From core business content to editing various lifestyle, finance, academic, e-commerce articles, I have honed my skills in English language to a certain level of perfection â€“ paired with the appropriate software, apps and AI tools that help me create quality deliverables. As an active academic, my research interests include multiple modernism(s), cinema, gender and sexuality, avant-garde, popular culture, and eco-criticism.

## Research Interests
